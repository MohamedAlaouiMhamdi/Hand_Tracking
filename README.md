This Python project utilizes the Mediapipe library to track hand landmarks in real-time from the webcam feed. It provides an interactive interface to visualize the hand landmarks and displays a highlighted circle around the tip of the index finger for better visibility.

## Features

- Real-time hand landmark detection using Mediapipe.
- Visualization of hand landmarks and bounding box on the video stream.
- Highlighting the tip of the index finger with a circle for easy identification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Mediapipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
